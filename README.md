<h1>💻Welcome to Janelle's Github </h1>
My name is Janelle Tenorio, and I received my B.S. Information Technology at Kennesaw State University in May 2025. I chose to major in Information Technology because IT focuses on the practical application of technology to solve real-world problems. I am interested in hands-on tasks, troubleshooting, and managing technology systems.
