<h1>üíªWelcome to Janelle's Github </h1>
My name is Janelle Tenorio and I am majoring in B.S. Information Technology at Kennesaw State University. I chose to major in Information Technology because IT is more focused on the practical application of technology to solve real-world problems. I am the type of person to be more interested in hands-on tasks, troubleshooting, and managing technology systems.
